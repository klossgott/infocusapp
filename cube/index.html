        <h3>What is The Cube?</h3>
        <p>The Cube is an imagination game and a tool for self-discovery. It involves visualizing five elements in a desert landscape: a cube, a ladder, a horse, a storm, and flowers. The way you imagine these elements and their relationships to one another reveals aspects of your personality, relationships, and outlook on life.</p>
