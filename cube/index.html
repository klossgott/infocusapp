        <div class="faq-question">What is The Cube?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The Cube is an imagination game and a tool for self-discovery. It involves visualizing five elements in a desert landscape: a cube, a ladder, a horse, a storm, and flowers. The way you imagine these elements and their relationships to one another reveals aspects of your personality, relationships, and outlook on life.</p>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-question">Who created The Cube?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The origins of The Cube are unclear, but it has been popularized through various books and online articles. It is often attributed to a Japanese psychologist, but this claim has not been definitively verified.</p>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-question">How do I play The Cube?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Simply relax, close your eyes, and allow yourself to visualize each element as it is described to you. There are no right or wrong answers; the most important thing is to be honest with your imagination and describe what comes to mind first.</p>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-question">What do the interpretations mean?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The interpretations are based on symbolic meanings that have been associated with the elements. For example, the cube often represents the self, the ladder symbolizes aspirations, and the horse represents relationships.</p>
          <p>Remember, the interpretations are not definitive. They are simply guidelines to help you reflect on your own visualizations. The most important insights come from your personal connections and understanding.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-question">Can I play The Cube more than once?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The first experience is the most genuine because you are unaware of the symbolic meanings. Knowing the interpretations may influence your imagination. However, revisiting your Cube later can reveal how your life and perspectives have evolved.</p>
