                "30. As your coach, my job is to find out the answer to these questions. Can you look yourself straight in the face and say you're playing full-out? What's stopping you from playing full-out, no matter the outcome? What does playing full-out mean to you?",
                "31. How can I serve you so powerfully that you will never forget this first call for the rest of your life?",
