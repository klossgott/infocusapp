            "6. What would you like to create? What's in the way of you creating that right now? (Steve Chandler's favorite two questions.)",
            "7. If you were to call me in 3 years and you're looking back on this conversation, what did we discuss that changed everything?",

            "14. What do you think is possible as an outcome from this call? (Then say) I want to open up you to the possibility that what you think is possible is nowhere near what's possible. What's possible is so much more.",
            "15. What would be really helpful to work on? What could we do today that would make the biggest impact in your life and move you to where you want to be?",
            "16. What are you afraid of? What do you believe is causing the fear? Is it valid? What would you do if you had no fear?",
            "17. How can you slow down to speed up?",
            "18. What energizes you? What drains you of energy? (Life-changing exercise you can do with clients)",
            "19. What do you really, really want? What's your secret dream?",
            "20. Imagine that I create miracles, what miracle would you want me to help you create today? Why haven't you created it already?",
            "21. What do you want to create? Why do you want it? What's in the way of you creating that right now? What kind of person do you need to be to create it?",

            "29. Given this situation, what do you want to create?",
            "30. As your coach, my job is to find out the answer to these questions. Can you look yourself straight in the face and say you're playing full-out? What's stopping you from playing full-out, no matter the outcome? What does playing full-out mean to you?",
            "31. How can I serve you so powerfully that you will never forget this first call for the rest of your life?",
            "32. A really great point of discussion is the truth that what got you to this level of success is exactly what will keep you from reaching the next level of success. What is that?",

            "36. Can you name all the things you love? (Notice how long before they name themselves.)",
            "37. I'd like you to imagine that it's three years from now and you call me up on the phone and say, 'Holy shit, coach. My life is amazing.' Now tell me all about your amazing life.",
            "38. Where are you making a contribution to something bigger than yourself?",

            "40. How's your family?",
            "41. How's business?",
            "42. What is the thing that when you are doing it, you totally forget about time?",
            "43. What does your heart long for?",
            "44. When was the time in your life that you felt most alive? What were you doing?",
            "45. What is the problem you wake up to every morning?",
