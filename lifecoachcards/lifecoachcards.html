            "13. What is it that you need to change in your life to get what you want today?",
            "14. What do you think is possible as an outcome from this call? (Then say) I want to open up you to the possibility that what you think is possible is nowhere near what's possible. What's possible is so much more.",
            "15. What would be really helpful to work on? What could we do today that would make the biggest impact in your life and move you to where you want to be?",
            "16. What are you afraid of? What do you believe is causing the fear? Is it valid? What would you do if you had no fear?",
            "17. How can you slow down to speed up?",
            "18. What energizes you? What drains you of energy? (Life-changing exercise you can do with clients)",

            "29. Given this situation, what do you want to create?",
            "30. As your coach, my job is to find out the answer to these questions. Can you look yourself straight in the face and say you're playing full-out? What's stopping you from playing full-out, no matter the outcome? What does playing full-out mean to you?",
            "31. How can I serve you so powerfully that you will never forget this first call for the rest of your life?",
            "32. A really great point of discussion is the truth that what got you to this level of success is exactly what will keep you from reaching the next level of success. What is that?",

            "36. Can you name all the things you love? (Notice how long before they name themselves.)",
            "37. I'd like you to imagine that it's three years from now and you call me up on the phone and say, 'Holy shit, coach. My life is amazing.' Now tell me all about your amazing life.",
            "38. Where are you making a contribution to something bigger than yourself?",

            "40. How's your family?",
            "41. How's business?",
            "42. What is the thing that when you are doing it, you totally forget about time?",
            "43. What does your heart long for?",
            "44. When was the time in your life that you felt most alive? What were you doing?",

            "63. What would you do if you knew less people?",
            "64. What do you take on that you should leave to others?",
            "65. What do you leave to others that you should be doing?",

            "126. What would happen if you fixed that right now?",
            "127. The reality of money is that we don't experience it—we experience what money can do for us.

            "133. Is there something else you can do to be even more successful?",
            "134. What will make your success inevitable?",
            "135. Who do you need to be to get that done?",
            "136. What have you not said so far?",
            "137. When you hit your goal, how do you think that will make you feel? How can you feel that way now?",
            "138. What action can we take right now in this moment on this call to get started?",
            "139. And what else? And what else? And what else? And what else? (Take them deeper and deeper)",
            "140. What's that thought that's keeping you from being comfortable?",
            "141. How are you creating this?",
            "142. What old habit are you going to let go of in order to be successful?",

            "149. What would it mean about you if you got what you want?",
            "150. What would you want if it wouldn't mean anything about you?",
            "151. What would be the worst thing for you about getting what you want?",
            "152. What would you want if you knew it would be okay if you got it?",
            "153. What are the goals you have that you don't want to do anything to make them happen but if they did, that would be awesome?",
