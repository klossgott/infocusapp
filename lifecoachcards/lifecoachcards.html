            "What do you want? And what else?",
            "What would you like to create? What's in the way of you creating that right now? (Steve Chandler's favorite two questions.)",
            "If you were to call me in 3 years and you're looking back on this conversation, what did we discuss that changed everything?",

            "What is it that you need to change in your life to get what you want today?",
            "What do you think is possible as an outcome from this call? I want to open up you to the possibility that what you think is possible is nowhere near what's possible. What's possible is so much more.",
            "What would be really helpful to work on? What could we do today that would make the biggest impact in your life and move you to where you want to be?",
            "What are you afraid of? What do you believe is causing the fear? Is it valid? What would you do if you had no fear?",
            "How can you slow down to speed up?",
            "What energizes you? What drains you of energy? (Life-changing exercise you can do with clients)",

            "Given this situation, what do you want to create?",
            "As your coach, my job is to find out the answer to these questions. Can you look yourself straight in the face and say you're playing full-out? What's stopping you from playing full-out, no matter the outcome? What does playing full-out mean to you?",
            "How can I serve you so powerfully that you will never forget this first call for the rest of your life?",
            "A really great point of discussion is the truth that what got you to this level of success is exactly what will keep you from reaching the next level of success. What is that?",
            "If you could be absolutely honest and release something, a secret you've been holding on to for too long, what would that be?",

            "What type of people can't you stand?",
            "What type of people do you fall for too easily?",
            "If someone held a gun to the head of a loved one and they'd die if you didn't take immediate action, what's the first tiny step you'd take?",
            "If you'd earn a million dollars by taking one small step right now, what would you do?",
            "What are you really committed to and what are you going to do about it?",
